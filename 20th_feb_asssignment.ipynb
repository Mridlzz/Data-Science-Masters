    "### In a Flask App, we have our own Webpage (Client) and a Server. The Server should process the data.  The Request, in Flask, is an object that contains all the data sent from the Client to Server. This data can be recovered using the GET/POST Methods. POST is used when your application expects user input to be received by command or an HTTP request, while GET gets all the information before it even has a chance for submission. Using both methods at once gives perfect freedom but still requires complex UI patterns like AJAX calls etc, with most common applications being frameworks where multiple forms are necessary such as Slack Webhooks, MailgunMailserver, and eCommerce Commerce Framework. With Flask-Request class instead, we donâ€™t have any need anymore since this API allows us flexible handling of many other situations."

When this function is called, a response object is returned, and the redirection happens to the target location with the status code. When a website is visited, server receives a request and after processing responds to the request with a three-digit code known as the HTTP code. In a programming world this status code that is returned as a response is known as Errors. Errors and redirect function goes hand in hand."
