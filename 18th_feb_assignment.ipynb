It is developed as an intermediate language so that applications built in various programming languages can communicate with each other effectively. Web services use SOAP for exchange of XML data between applications. SOAP supports both stateful and stateless operations. Stateful means that the server keeps the information that it receives from the client across multiple requests. These requests are chained together so that the server is aware about the previous requests. Examples are bank transactions, flight bookings, etc. Stateless messaging has enough information about the state of the client so that the server does not have to bother."

This information can be transferred in various formats via HTTP like, JSON, HTML, XLT, and Plain Text, but JSON is the most common language used due to its easy readability by machines and humans."

A completed request to a SOAP API is not cacheable by a browser, so it cannot be accessed later without resending to the API."
